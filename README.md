Xin chÃ o ðŸ‘‹

My name is Benji and I am currently software engineer at a startup building large-scale data ingestion pipelines for the purposes of telemetry, visualization, transformation, and anomoly detection in hardware. During my freetime I'm either actively developing [erdtree](https://github.com/solidiquis/erdtree), iterating on my [configs](https://github.com/solidiquis/dotfiles), learning something new, or trying to find time to engage in my other wide range of hobbies.

If you're someone who is interested in getting into software development as someone who is self-taught (I'm self-taught), are looking for career advice, or simply want to talk about programming then feel free to reach out to me in my socials.
