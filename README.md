**Benji** | **Full-stack programmer**
--
I'm a self-taught programmer who has been programming since November 18, 2018. Professionally, I am a full-stack software engineer working regularly with Ruby on Rails, React, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Heroku.

At the hobby capacity, I have a profound interest in graphics, Unix systems programming, terminal emulators, and concepts related to concurrency and parallelism.

Something that I am particularly passionate about is autodidacticism (aka self-teaching) as a form of self-empowerment. Knowledge is free and open-source, so I am willing to provide guidance to anyone interested in curating their own education to either become a programmer, or deepen their knowledge on any subject.
