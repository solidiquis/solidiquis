Xin chào 👋

My name is Benji and I am currently an engineer at this little startup called [Wefunder](https://wefunder.com). During my freetime I'm either actively developing [erdtree](https://github.com/solidiquis/erdtree), iterating on my [configs](https://github.com/solidiquis/dotfiles), learning something new, or trying to find time to engage in my other wide range of hobbies described in the above sequence of emojis.

If you're interested in chatting about programming, guitar, cinema, horror, anime, metal music, video games, fostering dogs, or even weightlifting, I can be found on Discord at `solidiquis#7196` or at the above linked socials.
